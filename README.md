# scratchflow
Inspired by [scratch](scratch.org), scratchflow is a hackathon project from the HackZurich 2016 with the official goal
of bringing the power of Tensorflow based Dataflow programming to beginners and visual learners.

But really we wanted to have fun and learn Elm/Tensorflow respectively.

Click on an entry in the list on the left, pull it to the right and it adds a node to the tree.

Shift clicking on an existent node enter edge mode, the next shift click on a valid node will add the edge in the 
dataflow model.

Python code and internal state is printed below.

Elapsed time: Pretty much 40h hours *2 two people. We are happy with this:)
